## You need to write a Todo list application. The application should have the following functionality:

- The ability to add a new entry
- Deleting an existing one, if it exists
- Editing an entry
- The ability to mark a note as completed
- Getting full information about an entry
- Getting a list of all notes
- Getting information on how many total notes are in the list and how many remain incomplete
- Searching for a note by name or content
- Additionally, the list should be extended with the ability to sort notes by status or creation time.

## Requirements for an entry:

- Each note must have a title, content, creation and edit dates, and a status
- Notes should not be empty
- Notes come in two types:
  - Default (regular)
  - Those that require confirmation when deleting or editing

## Usage examples:
In the file `todo-list-usage.ts`
